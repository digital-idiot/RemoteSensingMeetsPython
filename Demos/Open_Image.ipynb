    "Now we can open an geospatial image using the methods provided by `rasterio`. Here we will be opening an image available in the subdirectory `data`. The concerned can refered using their `file path`, which is `path` of directory where the file is located followed by the `file name` separated by the appropriate separator depending upon the platform. It is wirth mentioning that the `path` can be relative. Opening a supported image can be as simple as shown below. Notice that, in this case relative path has been used."

    "However, `rasterio` closely follws pythonic philosophy of file handling. Thus, an image can be opened using `with` block. In this case the file pointer is freed automaticaly when the control sequence comes out of the `with` block which is not only convenient but also efficient in terms of memory."
